## ***Highlighting your ideas***
Sometimes you want to enphasize a topic or word with **bold** and *italic*, 
and it is made by simply adding one asterisk before and after a word for italic and two asterisks for bold; three asterisks will render in a bold and italic word. 


## **Training on headers**
When writing a text with markdown you might put your topics and subtopics under a "heading mark" in which they will be leveled based on how many hashtags you use before writing your line.
As exampled below:

 |Heading Mark number | Levels |
 |--------------------|--------|
 |          #         |   1    |
 |         ##         |   2    |
 |       ######       |   6    |



## **Markdown listing**


### *Bulleted lists*


Each of your listed subjects has to be preceded by a "-" character

 
- Fruits
- Inside 
- a text
- for listing purposes


A nested list (Subtopics of the listed subjects) is made with an indentation before inserting "-" in your subtopic.

- Watermelons
  - Are watery
- Apples
  - Are acidic
- Bananas
  - Not my favorites

### *Ordered (numbered) lists*

Each of your listed subjects has to be preceded by a "1." later it will be converted automatically to a ordered numeration.

1. Watermelons
  1. cute
1. Apples
  1. not the brand
1. Bananas
  1. should not be in the list
 
## **Blockquotes**  

In markdown we use e-mail style > characters to generate a blockquote, similar as in listing, inserting a > character below a blockquote will nest another into that blockquote.

 >This is how a blockquote looks like
    >This is how a nested blockquote looks like
 >This is a second longer blockquote or the same blockquote as before,
 I think I'm writing the same word for tooo loooong, I have a chemistry test today
